        <h2>Why Hoopa exists</h2>
        <p>Hoopa's mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge of THE game of basketball.
          As a truly devoted hooper who has loved the game ever since I was a child, I wanted to foster an environment that would welcome any and all fans of the game.
          I want to connect the people who have knowledge of the game to the people who want it, who want to better their understanding of this game we all love.
          Basketball is meant to be shared- it is, after all, a team sport.

        <h3>Gather around for a debate</h3>
        <p>One of sports biggest joys, but especially in basketball, is debating.
          There is nothing quite like sitting down with friends and just duking it out on who topics like who the GOAT is, where this player is going to go in free agency, who would win in a hypothetical cross-era match up, etc.
          Everyone has their own opinions, and Hoopa allows them voice them online in a respectful environment.
